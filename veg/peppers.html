                    You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed
                    the world
                    once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't
                    know exactly
                    when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made
                    it out. Now
                    we
                    took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but
                    it wasn't.
                    Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.
                    Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit
                    while I'm in
                    a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case,
                    it don't
                    belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand
                    it over to
                    your dumb ass.
